# SQL and Power BI porject


For this project, I connected the AdventureWorks databases (link below) into MSSMS

[AdventuresWorks databases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms)


I then applied SQL queries and downloaded the datasets as a CSV file. Finally, I built a dashboard using Power BI to present the results
